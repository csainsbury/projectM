<title>
Implementation of risk prediction models in a non-diabetes cohort within NW London
</title>

</associated label>

<context>
we have access to all GP records from the unselected population of NW London
the aim will be to apply the current generation of risk prediction models (probably XGBoost based models described in the Dundee_Colab project documents) to people without diabetes.
could also aim to predict the development of diabetes (considering the potential new agents being tested in early-phase studies currently)

<current status>
slow progress
there is a form that I need to finalise and send off (this is listed as a task already)
