Explanation of Key Components
	1.	load_data & preprocess_data:
	•	Loads and merges lab, demographic, prescription, and mortality CSV files into a usable format.
	•	We do a simplistic “latest lab value” approach for demonstration.
	2.	build_action_map:
	•	Assigns each drug_name an integer ID, forming a discrete action space.
	3.	OfflinePrescribingEnv:
	•	A minimal environment representation for offline RL.
	•	Each patient is processed once (single-step episode).
	•	The reward is +1 if the patient is alive, 0 if deceased (toy example).
	•	The environment has a get_state(...) method that returns a numeric vector of [age, sex_code, eth_code, hba1c, bmi, sbp].
	4.	RandomPolicy:
	•	A trivial policy that randomly selects an action.
	5.	search_best_action:
	•	A toy “search” function. It tries multiple candidate actions from the RandomPolicy, directly checks the environment’s reward (in real life, you’d use a learned reward model), and picks the best.
	•	Resets the environment index each time to simulate repeated trials, which is cheating in a strictly “offline” scenario—but demonstrates the concept.
	6.	SimpleBCPolicy:
	•	A minimal Behavior Cloning policy that stores a dictionary of (state -> best_action).
	•	select_action looks up the stored best action for that state; otherwise picks random.
	7.	run_episode_with_bc & evaluate_bc:
	•	Illustrate how we gather “expert” actions using search_policy (RandomPolicy + reward-based selection) and then do a BC update.
	•	Then evaluate the BC policy over the entire environment.
	8.	main():
	•	Loads the data, merges/preprocesses, builds environment, instantiates policies, and runs a few training epochs (search + BC) plus evaluation.

Overall, this code provides a proof-of-concept pipeline showing how you might incorporate:
	•	Offline data ingestion
	•	Simple environment definition
	•	Discrete action mapping
	•	Naive search for best action
	•	Behavior cloning as a policy learning step

Use this prototype as a foundation to build more realistic prescribing RL solutions.
