        *   `hdl`: Current HDL cholesterol (mmol/L).
        *   `ldl`: Current LDL cholesterol (mmol/L).
        *   `mmalb`: Micro/macro albuminuria at diagnosis (0/1).
        *   `pvd`: Peripheral vascular disease at diagnosis (0/1).
        *   `sbp`: Current systolic blood pressure (mmHg).
        *   `smoker`: Current smoker (0/1).
        *   `wbc`: Current white blood cell count (imputed).
        *    `ampHist`: History of amputation (0/1).
        *   `chfHist`: History of congestive heart failure (0/1), imputed from prescription data.
        *   `ihdHist`: History of ischemic heart disease (0/1), from prescription & SCI CVD data.
        *   `strokeHist`: History of stroke (0/1), from SCI CVA field.
    *   **Output:** Probability of first MI in men from `t0` to `t1` in `/MIM`. Validation data from SCI diabetes MI records.

*   **MIFemale Model:**
    *   **Input:** `MODEL_MIF_MI_female_rebuild.R`
    *   **Features:**
        *   `t0`, `t1`: Time since diagnosis (years) at start and end of prediction window.
        *   `ethnicity`: NHS Scotland ethnicity.
        *   `ageDiag`: Age at diagnosis (years).
        *    `egfr`: Current eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2).
        *   `hba1c`: Current HbA1c (DCCT %).
        *   `ldl`: Current LDL cholesterol (mmol/L).
        *   `mmalb`: Micro/macro albuminuria at diagnosis (0/1).
        *   `pvd`: Peripheral vascular disease at diagnosis (0/1).
    *   **Output:** Probability of first MI in women from `t0` to `t1`.

**Proposed Task:** "Review Document Summary and Note Next Steps"
 - This subtask will ensure you have completely understood the contents of the summary.
**Additional Suggestion:**
    * Consider documenting the data sources for each of these fields, and the exact steps required to compute them (this would be useful if any of these processes need to be debugged)

**Justification in Bullets:**

*   **Conciseness:** The summary is significantly shorter than the original, achieving a 50-70% reduction in length while keeping all key information.
*   **Accuracy:** The summary retains all technical terms, data points, and specific values, ensuring the information is still precise.
*   **Clarity:** The structure is organized by model (amputation, blindness, MI male, MI female) and uses bullet points to improve readability.
*   **Actionable:** The output paths and specific file names provide a clear understanding of each model's inputs and outputs. The sub task prompts you to make a note of any areas that require further action.
*   **Time Consideration:** Completing the subtask "Review Document Summary and Note Next Steps" is a manageable block of time, and requires no extra reading.
*   **Completion Pattern:** Given that your most successful time block is currently unknown, this initial step will help you to better assess your optimal work periods going forward.
*   **Known Blockers**: No blockers have been identified - this means that any time might be productive at the moment.
