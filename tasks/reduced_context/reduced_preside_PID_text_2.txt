1. **Main Answer:** The PRESIDE Project Initiation Document (PID), version 0.9 dated 10-Jun-2024, outlines a project focused on primary care-led risk stratification and treatment escalation for Type 2 diabetes using SGLT2-I's and digital innovation. The project involves a facilitative and steering group, has defined objectives and workstreams, and addresses the need for improved diabetes management due to the high prevalence and burden of the disease. Key contacts and a summary of the workstreams are listed.

2. **Justification in Bullets:**
    *   **Project Goal:** The core aim is to use digital innovation to improve the management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) through risk stratification and treatment escalation using SGLT2-I's in primary care.
    *   **Project Structure:** The document details the facilitative and steering groups, including names and contact information for key individuals from NHS GG&C, AstraZeneca, and the University of Glasgow.
    *   **Key Statistics:** The document cites Scottish Government statistics on diabetes prevalence (317,000 people diagnosed, ~88.2% with T2DM) and high-risk individuals (620,000 estimated by Diabetes UK). It notes diabetes costs the NHS 9% of its total health expenditure.
    *   **Project Need:** The document highlights the decrease in performance in quality of care indicators post-2018 GMS contract changes, underscoring the need for new strategies.
    *   **Workstreams:** There are eight workstreams outlined, involving GP practice identification, risk stratification, pharmacy support, reconciliation, model retraining, output generation, scalability and integration, and health economic assessment.
    *  **Finance and Contracting**: Key sections on project finance, contracting and procurement are mentioned, with reference to risk and issue management.
    *   **Risk Assessment**: The approach to risk and benefit management, along with project controls, is mentioned.
    *   **Action Item**: Review the detailed workstreams and specific roles/responsibilities for further task planning, especially those assigned to S.MacBride-Stewart or C.Sainsbury.
    *   **Optimal Time:** This is recommended now, as your completion rate is currently 0%, so there is no particular block that is better or worse than any other for accomplishing this task.
