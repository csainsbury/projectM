**Summary:**

The PRESIDE project (Primary care led risk stratification and treatment escalation with SGLT2-I's using digital innovation in patients with Type 2 diabetes), documented in its Project Initiation Document (PID) version 0.9 from 10-Jun-2024, aims to define project management and success assessment. The document specifies project approach, objectives, scope, assumptions, and constraints. Key personnel include a Facilitative Group (led by Prof David Lowe, Dr. Kashif Ali, Dr. Hartesh Battu, Dr. Sean MacBride-Stewart, Dr. Anne Thomson, Dr. Chris Sainsbury, and Dr. Charlie Mayor) and a Steering Group (chaired by Dr. Sean MacBride-Stewart).  Astra Zeneca, eHealth, and R&I also have named representatives. The project seeks to address the burden of diabetes in Scotland (317,000 diagnosed, with an estimated 49,000 undiagnosed and 620,000 at high risk).  Diabetes costs the NHS approximately 9% of its budget and causes complications such as vision loss, kidney disease, and heart issues. The 2018 GMS contract changes resulted in a decline in reported Quality Outcome Framework indicators.  The project plan involves various workstreams, including: practice identification; risk stratification model development; pharmacy team support; reconciliation; model retraining; outputs; scalability; and health economic assessment. The project also covers communication, finance, contracting, risk management, benefit management, and control. Regular steering (quarterly) and management (weekly/fortnightly) group meetings are planned.

**Justification and Task Suggestions:**

*   **Task Definition:** The project involves significant detail and numerous stakeholders. A core task should be the development of a simple stakeholder map, listing key people and their individual responsibilities and accountabilities.
*   **Rationale:** This will support you in understanding the structure of the team around this project. This task will take a focused amount of time, rather than needing an extended period reviewing the documents.
*   **Optimal Time Block:** Given that your most successful time block is currently unknown, I recommend tackling this at a time when you feel most focused.
*   **Addressing Blockers:** As no specific blockers have been identified, this task can be undertaken at any available time. The relatively short time scale for this task will be beneficial given that current task completion rate is 0%.
*   **Linking to Project Goals:**  Understanding the different roles and accountabilities for this project will be useful for future project planning and allow you to allocate tasks and manage resources effectively.
*   **Additional Proactive Task:** Based on the document, a secondary task is to develop a list of questions based on this project document for discussion with the leads. This would be a short focused task to clarify any areas that might be unclear or where further detail is needed. This would benefit the project by allowing you to take the lead on clarifying key areas, rather than needing to wait for this information from elsewhere.
