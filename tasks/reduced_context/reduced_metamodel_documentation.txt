Okay, here's a summary of the provided document, addressing your request for a concise version that retains key information, technical details, and action items, while reducing the length by 50-70%:

**Summary:**

The MyWayIQ system utilizes linked electronic health record data, preprocessed via custom scripts with median imputation for missing values, for training diabetes risk prediction models. These include base models based on published algorithms for various complications (amputation, blindness, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and mortality) and metamodels trained as linear combinations of base model outputs, using hardcoded coefficients from Scottish data. The models were trained and validated using data from the Scottish National Diabetes dataset (SCI-Diabetes) and linked datasets, within Trusted Research Environments to ensure GDPR compliance. Model performance, measured using AUROC, AUPRC, F1Score, Sensitivity, and Specificity, was validated both internally and externally (North West London) with calibration performed on a Scottish Health Board dataset. Version control was managed via git outside of TREs, and a filenaming protocol within TREs. Code was passed to the tech team for SaMD integration. Post-market surveillance involves recalibration at each new deployment and every 2 years. For algorithm descriptions, see Document_1_AlgorithmDescription and Appendix_2_metamodel_flow. Metamodel performance and calibration plots are detailed in Appendix_3_5y_recalibration_plots.pdf.

*   **Data Management:** Data sourced from linked EHRs, preprocessed with custom scripts. Missing values imputed using the median. Data preparation scripts specific to each model.
