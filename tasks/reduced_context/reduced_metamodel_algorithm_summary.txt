**Summary of Diabetes Risk Prediction Metamodels Process**

This project develops a diabetes complication risk prediction system using R and Python. It combines literature-based models with metamodels, sensitivity analysis, and recalibration. Initially trained with Scottish Health Boards data, it was validated using data from North West London.

**Data Processing:** Raw data from CSV files, including demographics, lab results, and diagnoses, are preprocessed. Individual scripts handle each base modelâ€™s data needs. Missing data is imputed using the median, and time-to-event variables (t0, t1) are calculated relative to a fixed end_train_date. Data is saved as input files for each model. Shared functions handle date conversions, feature loading, and value extraction.

**Base Models:** The system includes models for predicting amputation, myocardial infarction (men and women), blindness, renal failure, and mortality. Each model takes preprocessed data, identifiers, and outcome values, returning predictions and input data. The main script executes these models with a sensitivity analysis that adjusts features across 1, 2, 5 and 10-year windows. Sensitivity coefficients are applied to features. The base models run both with and without sensitivity adjustments. The intermediate predictions are saved.

**Metamodels:** A metamodel function combines base model predictions via a weighted linear combination. It iterates through sensitivity coefficients and adjusts features as specified. Specific metamodels combine risk scores for microvascular, macrovascular, and any complications. Metamodel outputs are saved.

**Analysis and Calibration:** Sensitivity analysis uses the sensCoefs variable to vary features and visualize the impact on predictions using boxplots saved in a sensitivityPlots directory. Isotonic regression recalibrates predictions using a Scottish Health Board dataset, evaluating model performance using k-fold cross-validation and generating calibration plots.

**Configuration and Execution:** A configuration script defines sensitivity coefficients, model names, adjustable features, and a unique run ID. It adjusts input file time windows for multiple prediction timeframes. A master script calls the configuration, model functions, sensitivity analysis, and other required scripts.

The system provides a framework for clinical risk prediction models, and includes recalibration against an external dataset. It is built using R, with Python for calibration and visualization, and is designed for modularity and maintainability.
