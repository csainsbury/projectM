<current status>
functionally I have divided this project up into the following sections:
1. combination generation: this is underway. I have written code that will generate all possible combinations of a number of continuous and categorical features. some additional work required to work out how to summarise past medication history etc
2. synthetic data generation: the VAE method is complete. Struan is writing up at present, with a draft now available - summarised in vae_method.txt. we need to implement CTGAN and a diffusion method (being implemented by Rob Nagy).
3. TTE: Xander is working on translating the TrialEmulation R package into python
4. manifold: not yet started
5. Foundation Model training: not yet started
Overall -> start building pipeline linking steps: not yet started
</current status>

<task_notes>
medium term goal will be to chain together sections 1, 2 and 3.
once this is done we can start work on the manifold.
the foundation model training should be relatively straightforward.
