<title>
Combination of EHR and retinal image data using XGBoost models
</title>

<context>
ongoing project
funded by InnovateUK
collaboration with MWDH/Dundee university

in brief:
extraction of EHR data from population with type 2 diabetes
time-series measurements are managed by binning data (bins around 5 years). summary features generated within these bins: median value, last value, interquartile range, gradient of a linear regression and number of measures. other measures are either binary, categorical or ordinal categorical
corresponding retinal images are processed using RETFound, giving an embedding vector (size 1024)
EHR features (around 80 in number) are concatenated with RETFound embeddings
an XGBoost classifier was then trained to predict a variety of outcomes
outcomes of interest: incident chronic kidney disease, microalbuminuria, 3-point MACE, CV death, all-cause death
models were trained in a 4-fold split
a subset of phenotypically-constrained cases which represent low-risk individuals were extracted from each test set and the model was also tested on this group - the idea here is to assess whether we can predict an elevated risk of adverse outcome in a group of individuals who would otherwise be classified as 'healthy / low risk' using traditional risk scoring systems.
