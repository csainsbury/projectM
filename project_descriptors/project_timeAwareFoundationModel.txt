practically, the project is divided into 3 major sections:
1 EHR time aware model. this is now based on the moment-1-large model and is working at a basic level
2 development of a time aware retinal image model. this is at a planning stage with options being considered.
3 integration into a high-level fusion of elements 1 and 2. Elements of planning and execution of 1 and 2 will be dependent on a successful fusion and training.
